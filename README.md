# LLM-SQL
This project fine-tunes TinyLlama, a variant of the Llama model, for generating SQL queries from natural language queries. Using a dataset from Hugging Face, we adapt TinyLlama with QLoRA for efficient training. The model integrates with a Flask app on Google Colab, allowing users to query a PostgreSQL database.
